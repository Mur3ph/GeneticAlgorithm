# Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithms are a part of evolutionary computing, written in Java, area of Artificial Intelligence


## TODO: Currently Refactoring algorithm - Clean Code

- [x] Tests
- [ ] Single responsibility principle (SRP)
- [ ] Decoupling	
- [x] Dependancy Injection
- [x] Better naming convension
- [ ] Seperation

## Design Patterns

1. **S.O.L.I.D** [go-to](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
  * **Single-responsiblity principle** - A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
  * **Open-closed principle** - Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  * **Liskov substitution principle** - Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
  * **Interface segregation principle** - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
  * **Dependency Inversion Principle** - Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** [go-to wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)
  * ie. Similar principle to **Single-responsiblity principle**
